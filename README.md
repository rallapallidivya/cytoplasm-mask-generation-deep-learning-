Cytoplasm mask generation using u-net model

Data

Images were collected from colorectal cancer cell line with 540 original images which were augmented to 1000 

Model 

U-Net: A deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation that uses an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to capture spatial hierarchies in images, particularly effective in medical image segmentation. Tried inferencing through the object based detection; Gives a satisfactory output so far, planning to train the model and check the results.
